# SDC-vehicle-detection
The goal of this project is to implement a simple vehicle detection pipeline from the vision system in the car. Vehicles are detected by first training a classifier on car and non-car sample data sets and using a sliding window search on the input frames to detect cars. The features vectors, heat map thresholds, sliding window scales used to train the classifier and detect car images have been experimented with quite a bit to derive at the final values.

Even though HOG classifier coupled with an SVM classifier is simple, it is clear that these techniques are not sufficient to build a robust pipeline to detect vehicles in real time. A hardware software hybrid approach where some of these image processing functions are implemented in hardware might be needed. 

Key steps of this project are:
* Examined the dataset of car and non-car images
* Extracted featureset for the images by appending 1) Spatial transform 2) Color histograms on all channels and 3) Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) 
* Train a classifier Linear SVM classifier
* Implement a sliding window search on the input frames and use the trained classifier to search for vehicles in each window
* For all classifications, create a cumulative heatmap on multiple frames and apply a threshold to remove false positives. 
* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected

### Data Set

The data set used is comprised of images taken from the GTI vehicle image database, the KITTI vision benchmark suite. They comprise of two sets - car images and non-car images. Total data set contains

| Dataset       | Images        | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:| 
| Car           | 8792          | 
| Non-car       | 8968          |

Here are some random images from the Car data set

And some random images from the non-car data set

### Feature extraction and Histogram of gradients

Feature vector is generated by combining color histograms, spatial bins and histogram of gradients. The images are first converted from RGB into YCrCb color space and the above tranforms are applied.

Feature extraction is implemented in the function `tracking_pipeline/extract_features()`. Spatial binning and color histograms are implemeted as shown below.

```python
    def bin_spatial(img, size=(32, 32)):
        color1 = cv2.resize(img[:,:,0], size).ravel()
        color2 = cv2.resize(img[:,:,1], size).ravel()
        color3 = cv2.resize(img[:,:,2], size).ravel()
        return np.hstack((color1, color2, color3))

    def color_hist(img, nbins=32):    #bins_range=(0, 256)
        # Compute the histogram of the color channels separately
        channel1_hist = np.histogram(img[:,:,0], bins=nbins)
        channel2_hist = np.histogram(img[:,:,1], bins=nbins)
        channel3_hist = np.histogram(img[:,:,2], bins=nbins)
      
        # Concatenate the histograms into a single feature vector
        hist_features = np.concatenate((channel1_hist[0], channel2_hist[0], channel3_hist[0]))
        return hist_features
```

Histogram of gradients are calculated using the scikit-learn function `hog()` and implemeted through `get_hog_features()` as shown below

```python
    def get_hog_features(img, orient, pix_per_cell, cell_per_block, 
                            vis=False, feature_vec=True):
        # Call with two outputs if vis==True
        if vis == True:
            features, hog_image = hog(img, orientations=orient, 
                                  pixels_per_cell=(pix_per_cell, pix_per_cell),
                                  cells_per_block=(cell_per_block, cell_per_block), 
                                  transform_sqrt=False, 
                                  visualise=vis, feature_vector=feature_vec)
            return features, hog_image

        # Otherwise call with one output
        else:      
            features = hog(img, orientations=orient, 
                       pixels_per_cell=(pix_per_cell, pix_per_cell),
                       cells_per_block=(cell_per_block, cell_per_block), 
                       transform_sqrt=False, 
                       visualise=vis, feature_vector=feature_vec)
            return features       
```

HOG parameters of orientation, pixels per cell and cells per block were obtained by experimentation. For the color space, while RGB gave good values, converting it to YCbCr seemed to better detect car features. Final values for HOG parameters are shown below

| Parameter        | Value         | 
|:----------------:|:-------------:| 
| colorspace       | YCbCr         | 
| Channel          | ALL           |
| Orientations     | 9             | 
| pixels per cell  | 8             |
| cell per block   | 2             |

### Training a SV classifier
The next step is to train a linear support vector classifier. To do this first, the feature set is normalized and separated into a 80/20 train to test splot.

```python
X = np.vstack((car_features, notcar_features)).astype(np.float64)                        
# Fit a per-column scaler
X_scaler = StandardScaler().fit(X)
# Apply the scaler to X
scaled_X = X_scaler.transform(X)

# Define the labels vector
y = np.hstack((np.ones(len(car_features)), np.zeros(len(notcar_features))))


# Split up data into randomized training and test sets
rand_state = np.random.randint(0, 100)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    scaled_X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=rand_state)
```

A Linear SVC is then straight forward to train as shown below. This is implemeted in the file 

```python
# Use a linear SVC 
svc = LinearSVC()
svc.fit(X_train, y_train)
# Check the score of the SVC
print('Test Accuracy of SVC = ', round(svc.score(X_test, y_test), 4))

```
A test accuracy of 99% is achieved is achieved on the dataset.

### Sliding window search

The next step of the pipeline is to implement a sliding window search as shown in function `findcars()`. Since cars and the road only occupy the bottom portion of the image, sliding window technique is applied only to the lower portion of the image. Scaling of the windows was experimented with quite a bit. Eventaually scales of [0.8, 1.0 and 1.8] were used on the image. 




This entire pipeline is implemented in the file `gen_detection_pipeline.py`. Shown below is an image before and after passing through the pipeline

###Video Output

Here are links to the [video output](./output_video/adv_lane_track.mp4).

Another version is shown [here](./output_video/adv_lane_track1.mp4). The difference in both videos is mostly due to the areas selected for perspective transform and thresholds selected for color and gradient transforms.

###Discussion and further work
This project is aN introduction to camera calibration, color and perspective transforms and curve fitting functions. However, it is not very robust and depends heavily on many factors going right. 

As you can see the pipeline is not robust in areas where the road has strong shadows and is wobbly. Also sections of the road with lighter color(concrete sections) combined with reflections of the sun make detecting lane especially the white dotted right lines much harder. There is already significant volume of academic research on shadow detection and elimination in images and this is an area that i would like understand and implement in the near future.
